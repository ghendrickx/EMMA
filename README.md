# EMMA
The _Ecotope Map Maker based on Abiotics_ (EMMA) facilitates the translation from hydrodynamic model output data to 
ecotope maps. _Ecotopes_ are ecological units that are defined by abiotic, biotic, and anthropogenic local conditions.
An _ecotope_ is a more-or-less homogeneous natural unit. In many instances, the word _habitat_ is used where here the 
word _ecotope_ is used, as _habitat_ originally refers to the living environment of a single species, while _ecotope_ 
refers to an ecosystem as it can be mapped.

This simple `python`-interface allows to map ecotopes (or habitats) based on the abiotic output from an hydrodynamic 
model. It does so by a modified version of the [ZES.1](https://edepot.wur.nl/174540) classification system. The
hydrodynamic model must contain the following hydrodynamic parameters:
-   water depth;
-   water level;
-   flow velocity; and
-   salinity.
